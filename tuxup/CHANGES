Approximate change log for TUXUP by version.

(For more detailed changes, see the ChangeLog file.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Current:

0.4.0:

* Now recognizes the version number of the USB hex file.

* Send the right command for the dongle to exit correctly from bootloader.

* Show progress when programming.

* main() now returns an error when programming fails for any reason.

* Cleanup.

* Removed unused EXTERNAL_FLASH, we're not going to support that option
  within tuxup.

0.1.1:

  * Added a check whether dfu-programmer is installed.
  * Checking if the old firmware is used and tell to replug with the button pressed.
  * Displayed messages have been improved and cleaned.

0.1.0:

  * BUG: fixed bug #1 Segfault when a hex file contained a line of data that
    ended exactly at the end of a segment. The segmnt was never sent to the USB
    in this case.
  * Use CFLAGS in the Makefile, cleaned the code by removing unused variables
    and avoid any warning.
  * BUG: segfault when the given filename didn't have an extension.
  * Uses interrupt usb requests and not bulk anymore, this is not compatible
    with the old firmware so to update it, you have to press the belly button
    when plugging.
  * Connection now checks for 5 seconds before claiming that tux is not found.
  * Added autodetection of the CPU to be programmed based on the CPU field in
    hex files or names of eep files.
  * Added version display when programming hex files.
  * Changed the usage, replaced the old argument parsing with getopt.
  * Added --version, --help, --pretend and --verbose options.
  * Added --main option to reprogram tuxcore and tuxaudio only.
  * Added support for usb programming which is a simple front-end to
    dfu-programmer. dfu-programmer needs to be installed.
  * Now uses defines from commands.h for CPU numbers, I2C addresses, etc.
  * Code cleanup

Version 0.0.1:

  * Initial public release.

TUXUP is a computer side uploader utility for the tuxdroid robot of Kysoh. It
is used to upgrade the firmware of all MCU's included in tuxdroid and it's
dongle.

DEPENDENCIES

In order to reprogram the USB CPU, tuxup uses 'DFU Programmer'.
'DFU Programmer' is a linux based command-line programmer for Atmel (8051 &
AVR) chips with a USB bootloader supporting ISP.
Download it at http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/
and install it as explained in the README file.

CONNECTION

You need to setup tuxdroid in bootloading mode by following this sequence:
  1. connect the dongle on the USB port;
  2. startup tuxdroid while pushing on it's head button;
  3. connect the white cable between tuxdroid and the dongle.

UPLOAD

To check all your hexfiles and get version numbers:
   > ./tuxup --all --pretend path/to/hex/folder/
To upload all new firmwares:
   > ./tuxup --all path/to/hex/folder/
To upload only the 2 main CPU's of Tux Droid:
   > ./tuxup --main path/to/hex/folder/
To upload a hex file:
   > ./tuxup hex_file

ERROR

If the uploading fails for any reason, one of the programs of your tuxdroid
will most probably be corrupted but the bootloader should stay unaffected. So
all you have to do is try again until it passes. You have to reset tux in most
cases after any failure. To reset and reconnect, do:
  1. switch off tuxdroid;
  2. disconnect the dongle;
  3. startup tuxdroid while pushing on it's head button;
  4. connect the dongle on the USB port;
  5. retry the upload command.
